Below you can find a brief description of projects I have worked on with a link to code repositories.

## R Projects

### Workforce Simulator

I built a workforce simulator in the R package shiny to estimate utilization with different headcount inputs. See the code here [Workforce Folder](https://github.com/tstuart8/Workforce-Simulator)

## Python Projects

### SLA Simulation

I used the simpy library in Python to build a simulation for reducing the SLAs guaranteed by a workforce. See the code here [SLA Simulation](https://github.com/tstuart8/SLA-Simulator)

## Academic Projects

### Final Project: Exercise Quality and Sleep Programs effect on Cancer

I analyzed the effect of sleep programs and exercise quality on cancer patients fatigue and quality of life. See the code here [Exercise and Sleep](https://github.com/tstuart8/Final_Project)

### Time Series Course

Completed a time series course focused on Arima and Autoregression time series models. See the code here [Time Series](https://github.com/tstuart8/Time_Series_Class)

### Computational and Graphical Methods

Completed a course in computational and graphical methods in R. See some chart examples below.
