Below you can find a brief description of projects I have worked on with a link to code repositories.

# R Projects

## Workforce Simulator

I built a workforce simulator in the R package shiny to estimate utilization with different headcount inputs. See the code here [Workforce Folder](https://github.com/tstuart8/Workforce-Simulator)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Python Projects

## SLA Simulation

I used the simpy library in Python to build a simulation for reducing the SLAs guaranteed by a workforce. See the code here [SLA Simulation](https://github.com/tstuart8/SLA-Simulator)
